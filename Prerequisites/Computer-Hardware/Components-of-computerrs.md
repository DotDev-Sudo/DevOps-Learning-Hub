## 1. Input Unit

The **Input Unit** is responsible for accepting data and converting it into a format the computer can understand (binary). Input devices allow users to interact with the computer and provide the necessary instructions.

### Common Input Devices:

* **Keyboard**: Used to type text and commands.
* **Mouse**: A pointing device to select and interact with on-screen elements.
* **Scanner**: Converts physical documents into digital formats.
* **Microphone**: Captures audio input.

### Key Characteristics:

- Accepts user data.
- Converts data into binary format.
- Sends data to the CPU for processing.

## 2. Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer. It performs all processing tasks by executing instructions from programs and input data.

### Components of the CPU:

#### 2.1 Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)

The **ALU** handles all mathematical calculations and logical operations:

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- **Logical Operations**: Comparisons (e.g., greater than, less than).

#### 2.2 Control Unit

The **Control Unit** directs the operation of the computer:

- Fetches instructions from memory.
- Decodes and executes instructions.
- Coordinates the activities of the ALU, memory, and input/output devices.

#### 2.3 Memory Registers

Registers are small storage locations within the CPU that temporarily hold data or instructions currently being processed. They allow the CPU to access data quickly.

- **Examples of Registers**:
  - **Accumulator**: Stores intermediate results.
  - **Program Counter (PC)**: Tracks the address of the next instruction.

## 3. Output Unit

The **Output Unit** takes processed data from the CPU and presents it in a human-readable format. Output devices help users see the results of computations or inputs.

### Common Output Devices:

* **Monitor**: Displays visual data.
* **Printer**: Produces hard copies of digital documents.
* **Speakers**: Outputs sound.

### Key Characteristics:

- Converts binary data into human-readable formats.
- Presents processed data as text, images, or sound.

## Conclusion

The components of a computer work together to provide a seamless user experience. Input devices gather data, the CPU processes it, and output devices present the results in a meaningful way.

Understanding these components is the first step toward gaining deeper knowledge of how computers function.
