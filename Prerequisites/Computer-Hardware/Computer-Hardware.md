## üñ•Ô∏è Components of a Computer

A computer has three essential components:

---

### 1.1 Input Unit

The **Input Unit** includes devices that:  
- Receive input from the user and convert it into binary format (understood by the computer).  
- Send the binary data to the processor for further processing.

**Common Input Devices:**  
- Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick, Scanner, Microphone, etc.

**Key Characteristics:**  
- Accepts user input.  
- Converts input into binary.  
- Passes data to the processor.

### 1.2 Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The **CPU** is the "brain" of the computer. It:  
- Fetches instructions from memory.  
- Interprets and executes them.  
- Manages data processing tasks.

#### Components of the CPU:

1. **1.2.1 Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU):**  
   - Performs arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction).  
   - Executes logical operations (e.g., comparisons).  

2. **1.2.2 Control Unit:**  
   - Manages and controls all CPU activities.  
   - Handles data flow between components.

3. **1.2.3 Memory Registers:**  
   - Temporary storage within the CPU.  
   - Stores data and instructions actively used by the processor.

---

### 1.3 Output Unit

The **Output Unit** includes devices that:  
- Convert processed binary data into human-readable formats.  
- Display or print this information for the user.

**Common Output Devices:**  
- Monitor, Printer, Plotter, Speakers, etc.

**Key Characteristics:**  
- Translates binary data into human-readable output.  
- Displays or prints processed information.
