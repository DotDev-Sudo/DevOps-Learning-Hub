# 🌟 Operating Systems: Introduction and Syllabus 🌟

## 📖 Introduction to Operating Systems

An **Operating System (OS)** is a software layer that acts as an intermediary between the computer hardware and the user. It manages hardware resources and provides essential services for computer programs, ensuring the system runs efficiently and securely. 

### 🔑 Key Functions of an Operating System:
- **Resource Management**: Allocates and manages CPU, memory, storage, and I/O devices.
- **Process Management**: Handles process creation, scheduling, and termination.
- **File System Management**: Manages data storage and retrieval through structured file systems.
- **User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface (command-line or GUI) to interact with the system.
- **Security and Protection**: Safeguards data and system integrity against unauthorized access.

### 🌍 Examples of Popular Operating Systems:
- **Windows OS**
- **macOS**
- **Linux Distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.)**
- **Android**
- **iOS**

Operating Systems are fundamental to computer science, as they form the backbone of any computing device.
