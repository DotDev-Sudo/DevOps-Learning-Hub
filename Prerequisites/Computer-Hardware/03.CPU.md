# 1.4.4 Intel Pentium with MMX Technology
MMX sometimes stands for Multimedia Extensions or Matrix Math Extensions. The main purpose of this extension is to provide hardware support for Multimedia applications. The following are the important features of MMX extensions:
- It has got twice the primary cache comparative to earlier processors. It has got 16 KB each for level 1 data and instruction caches.
- Cache mapping is improved here with the 4-way set associative.
- The pipeline features increases the executions levels to 6 stages.
- It helps in optimal use of pipelines by running the instructions in two executing pipes.
- Due to the branch prediction device the accuracy is improved.
- Efficient in the instruction decoder.

This too has overdrive technology that has the above specified changes.

## 1.4.5 Intel Pentium Pro (P6 machine)
This is the successor of the Pentium processor. The performance achievement is approximately 50% higher than a Pentium of the same clock speed. The following are the technical enhancements along with the other features mentioned in the earlier generation processors:
- **Super Pipelining**: The Pentium Pro dramatically increases the number of execution steps to 14, from the Pentium's 5.
- This introduces Integrated Level 2 Cache compared to all earlier processors; achieves more performance instead of motherboard based cache.
- The Pentium Pro is optimized for running 32-bit code and so gives a greater performance improvement over the Pentium when using the latest software.
- The address BUS on the Pentium Pro is widened to 36 bits, giving it a maximum addressability of 64 GB of memory.
- Quad processor configurations are supported with the Pentium Pro compared to only dual with the Pentium.
- Instructions flowing down the execution pipelines can complete out of order.

**Superior Branch Prediction Unit** helps in the branch target buffer to double the size of the Pentium's and its accuracy is increased.
- **Register Renaming**: This feature improves parallel performance of the pipelines.
- **Speculative Execution**: The Pro uses speculative execution to reduce pipeline stall time in its RISC core.

## 1.4.6 Intel Pentium II
The PC community has confirmed to adopt Pro processors and MMX technology. Later Intel tried combining both the features, and the result is found in 1997 which they named it Pentium II. Therefore, Pentium II consists of a 32-bit operating system and software. It also has new instructions necessary to handle media with the help of MMX technology. Pentium II is capable of performing 2 times better than the 200 MHz Pentium processor. This has the evolutionary effect in performance over Pro with the following features:
- **Doubled Level 1 Cache**: Level 1 cache is increased in size, from 16 KB to 32 KB total (16 KB + 16 KB).
- **Segment Register Caches**: These special caches are used to help the Pentium II process 16-bit code somewhat more efficiently. The Pentium Pro was optimized for 32-bit processing, meaning that it did not deal with 16-bit code quite as well.
- **Deeper Write Buffers**: The write buffers were increased in size, producing a small performance improvement.

## 1.4.7 Intel Core 2
This has the ability to handle the 64-bit data transfer in a multicore processor. The following are the features of Core 2 processors:
- The processor speeds range from 1 GHz to 3 GHz.
- They have Level 2 cache of 2 MB or 4 MB.
  
Intel Core 2 has three versions:
- **Core 2 Solo**: Handles single-core processors.
- **Core 2 Duo**: Handles dual-core processors on a single chip.
- **Core 2 Quad**: Handles two chips, each with 2 cores, resulting in a multi-chip module of 4 cores.

## 1.4.8 Intel Atom
As we grow in technology, the size kept on decreasing with an increase in power and performance. Therefore, to serve netbook purposes, Intel created Atom. A netbook is smaller than a laptop computer and is generally used for internet access and portability. Since netbooks are small, the processors used need to be small as well to fit inside the available space. The following are the features of Intel Atom:
- The speed ranges from 1 GHz to 2 GHz.
- Level 1 cache is increased in size to 32 KB, and Level 2 cache is 512 KB.

Atom has been classified into two versions:
- **Single Core**
- **Dual Core**

## 1.4.9 AMD CPUs
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are the non-Intel chips that have become real competitors to Intel CPUs. The industry considers them to be compatible and perfectly designed. There is strong competition among processors, as each offers better performance than the other. If AMD processors outperform Intel CPUs in improved processing power and operating speeds, Intel CPUs excel in 3D and network parameters. Therefore, the selection of the processor depends on the application's requirements. AMD processors incorporate write-back cache and enhanced power management features, including 3-volt operations, system management mode (SMM), and clock control. Higher versions of AMD are compatible with all x86 operating systems and software. They also have heat sinks and fans that help reduce the heat generated by the processors.

# 1.5 CPU Overclocking
Though the CPU and microprocessor are used synonymously, in reality, the CPU is a part of the microprocessor. Microprocessors differ from CPUs in characteristics such as instruction set, bandwidth, and clock speed. Clock speed is the measure of the number of instruction sets the microprocessor executes in one second. Overclocking, also known as speed margining, involves making the CPU run faster than its actual speed. This increases the performance of the CPU, often to maximize processor performance at little or no additional cost. For example, increasing the BUS speed on the motherboard can make an Intel Pentium III processor running at 933 MHz perform at speeds equivalent to a Pentium III 1050 MHz processor.

Despite its performance benefits, overclocking is not always commonly practiced.

## 1.5.1 Overclocking Requirements
The key elements that affect overclocking success/failure are:
1. **CPU**: Intel CPUs are more successful in overclocking. AMD and Cyrix CPUs, however, often run at their rated limits, which makes overclocking more challenging. Be cautious of remarked and resold CPUs that may already run at high speeds.
2. **Motherboard**: Overclocking may fail due to weak signals or lack of electrical support for overclocked CPUs. The motherboard should support a wide range of voltage variations for the CPU.
3. **System Memory**: RAMs can handle overclocking systems until the BUS speed exceeds 66 MHz. Higher-end RAM like EDO RAM and SD RAM can help handle BUS speeds above 66 MHz.
4. **CPU Cooling**: Standard heat sinks and fans may not cool the excess heat produced by overclocking. Extra cooling is needed to maintain stable performance.

## 1.5.2 Potential Pitfalls
The major pitfalls of CPU overclocking are intermittent operations, shortened lifespan, and outright failure:
- **Intermittent Operations**: The excess heat can cause signal errors, leading to system crashes. The system may need to be shut down until the CPU cools down.
- **Shortened Lifespan**: Excessive heat from overclocking may shorten the lifespan of the CPU. A CPU that could last 10 years might only last 2-5 years under heavy overclocking.
- **Outright Failure**: If the CPU exceeds its temperature limits, it may fail outright. Even a single failed transistor can destroy CPU performance.

## 1.5.3 Overclocking the System
You can overclock the CPU in three ways: overclocking the processor, overclocking the system BUS, or overclocking both. The three major steps in overclocking are:
1. Change the **BUS Speed**: The BUS speed determines how the CPU communicates with other parts of the computer. To change the BUS speed, follow these steps:
   1. Check your motherboard manual for terms like ‚Äúclock speed‚Äù or ‚ÄúCPU External Frequency Selection.‚Äù
   2. Adjust the jumpers to create a new BUS speed.
   3. If using a motherboard with soft menu technology, adjust the settings in the CMOS setup menu.
   4. Increase the BUS speed step by step, one step at a time.
2. Change the **Multiplier**: The multiplier is used to measure the ratio of internal and external clock rates. To change the multiplier:
   1. Check the motherboard manual for "Clock Multiplier" jumpers.
   2. Adjust the multiplier settings in the CMOS setup if your motherboard supports it.
3. Change the **Voltage Supply**: If needed, increase the voltage supply to ensure the CPU runs reliably at higher speeds. Be cautious as this may lead to higher temperatures, which require better cooling.

## 1.5.4 Overclocking the Intel Processors
Intel processors are generally considered the easiest to overclock. Processors can be boosted to increase performance. When overclocking Intel processors, you can adjust the BUS speed, multiplier, or voltage supply.

**Overclocking the Intel Celeron**: The Celeron is a low-cost version of the Pentium and is quite overclocking-friendly. However, its locked multiplier and BUS speed may limit performance. Overclocking depends on motherboard features such as the availability of a higher front-side BUS and voltage supply adjustments. Modern motherboards with software for adjusting settings make overclocking easier.

**Overclocking the Intel Pentium**: To overclock Pentium processors, the most common method is increasing the clock multiplier. However, increasing the front-side BUS speed is often more effective. This requires reducing the clock multiplier to maintain system stability. Overclocking usually voids the warranty and requires careful monitoring of temperatures and cooling.
