# 2.3.3 Memory Techniques 💡

When choosing the memory architecture for your system, it's crucial to select one that balances performance and cost effectively. Here are some of the commonly used memory techniques that can help you make an informed decision.

## 🧩 Paged Memory
Paged memory involves transferring data from secondary memory (e.g., hard drives) to main memory in blocks called **pages**. This allows the CPU to use free address space in the memory. 

- **Key Benefit:** Zero wait state if accessing the current page.
- **Wait State:** 1 or 2 wait states can be allowed if accessing a page outside the current one.
- **Common Use:** Found in high-end systems like i286, PS/2, and i386.

## 🔄 Interleaved Memory
Interleaved memory combines two memory banks, meaning while one bank is being processed, the other bank can read data. 

- **Performance:** This method improves performance because two memory modules work in parallel.
  
## 💨 Memory Cache
Memory cache is a small, super-fast memory located between the CPU and RAM. It stores frequently accessed data to speed up performance.

- **Cache Miss:** If the data isn't in the cache, the system must access the slower DRAM, leading to a **cache miss**.
- **Types:** There are **internal cache** (on CPU) and **external cache** (outside the CPU).

## 🛑 Shadow Memory
Shadow memory involves transferring data from **ROM** to **RAM** to speed up access. Since ROM is slower, shadow memory allows faster data retrieval.

- **Benefit:** Access content from **RAM** rather than slow **ROM**.

- **Current Systems:** Up to 1GB of RAM.

## 💡 2.4.2 Filling Memory Banks

A memory **bank** refers to filling the memory to match the data bus width. Here's what you need to keep in mind:

- **Memory Amount:** The bank must be filled with enough memory. For example, if Bank 0 has 8MB, then Bank 1 should also have 8MB.
- **Memory Matching:** All modules in a bank must have the same size and speed.

### DIMM Installation Tips:
- **Identical DIMMs:** Install them in either Bank 0 or Bank 1.
- **Different Sizes:** Larger DIMM goes in Bank 0, smaller in Bank 1.
- **Single-sided vs. Double-sided DIMMs:** Install single-sided DIMMs in Bank 0 and double-sided DIMMs in Bank 1.

# 2.5 Troubleshooting 🛠️

Even with the best devices, memory failures can happen. Here’s how to troubleshoot memory-related issues.

## 🧪 Memory Test Equipment
Use testing devices to identify memory failures. A **modular-based memory tester** checks memory modules and displays results on an LCD. This helps eliminate guesswork.

## 🔧 Repairing SIMM/DIMM/RIMM Sockets
The socket must hold the module firmly. If a socket becomes damaged, follow these steps for repairs:

1. **Remove the motherboard.**
2. **Detach the damaged socket.**
3. **Solder the new socket.**

### Alternative Solutions:
- **Rubber Band Fix:** Use a medium-weight rubber band to hold the module and socket in place.
- **Epoxy:** For broken or cracked sockets, epoxy can be used temporarily. Ensure good ventilation.

## ⚡ Contact Corrosion
Contact corrosion occurs when metals touch without a protective layer, creating an electrolytic cell. This issue can be solved by cleaning the contacts with a cotton swab and contact cleaner. Ensure that the memory and socket make proper contact.
